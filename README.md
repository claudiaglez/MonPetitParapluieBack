# Mon Petit Parapluie :open_umbrella: <br>


Salut! Welcome to Mon Petit Parapluie, a showcase to show all the cross stitch projects I have been making over the years.




## üéØ Project Overview


This project is my Final Individual Project for the full-stack development Bootcamp FemCoders Norte in Factor√≠a F5.

## Backend Stack


This repository serves as the **backend stack** for my project. It is intricately linked with my [**frontend repository**](https://github.com/claudiaglez/MonPetitParapluieFront)<br><br>

Copy the .env.example file and rename it to .env. Then, configure the necessary environment variables, such as the database connection:

Edit the .env file and set values for DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_DATABASE, DB_USERNAME, and DB_PASSWORD according to your MySQL setup.

You can access it at :  ```http://localhost:8000.

## üåê API Routes


I‚Äôve developed several API routes using Laravel to handle HTTP requests. These routes are essential for communication between the frontend and backend of our application.


**Product Routes:**<br>
/api/articles:
Retrieves a list of all available articles.<br>
/api/articles/{id}: Retrieves details of a specific product by its ID.<br>
**Category Routes:**<br>
/api/categories: Retrieves a list of all product categories.<br>
/api/categories/{id}: Retrieves details of a specific category by its ID.<br>
